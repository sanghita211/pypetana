# Petridish Image Extraction Tool and Dynamic Feature Analysis in Biological Systems

## Introduction
This repository focuses on the extraction of growth images of biological organisms on petri dishes and the calculation of dynamic features such as _area_, _perimeter_, _circularity_ and _fractal dimension_.

## System 
Folder _s-petana_: Compatibility with _scanner-derived_ experimental data.
* Collection of scipts related to bio-growth in petridishes

## Methods

* Image extraction
* Calculation of area, perimeter of growth contour
* Calculation of circularity based on area and perimeter of growth contour
* Calculation of Fractal dimension of growth contour

## Documentation

* Description of core function features related to _Image_Extraction_Routine_ & _Dynamical_Parameter_Extraction_Routine_
* Description of _Main_Execution_Blocks_ for _Image_Extraction_Routine_ & _Dynamical_Parameter_Extraction_Routine_



## Contributing

* New features, bug fixes, documentation, tutorial examples, code testing is welcome in the developer community!
